## Installation


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/TheFellowHacker/subActive.git
  cd subActive
  chmod +x subActive
  ./subActive.sh -h
```
    
## Usage

```bash
./subActive.sh -h
SubActive is an active subdomain enumeration bash script that discovers subdomains for websites using various tools.

Usage: ./subActive.sh [options]

Options:
  -h, --help               Display this help message
  -d, --domain <name>      Specify a single domain name to enumerate its subdomains
  -sL, --subdomains-list   Specify a file containing a list of subdomains
  -pw, --wordlist <file>   Specify a wordlist for PureDNS
  -vw, --wordlist <file>   Specify a wordlist for VHost
  -p, --permuted-list <file> Specify a permutations list
  -ip, --ip-addresses <file> Specify a file containing IP addresses
  -r, --resolvers <file>   Specify a file containing DNS resolvers
  -o, --output <directory> Specify output directory (optional, if not specified, then a directory will be created with the domain name)

Example: ./subActive.sh -d example.com -sL <subdomain_list> -pw <puredns_wordlist> -vw <vhost_wordlist> -p permutations-list.txt -ip ip-addresses.txt -r fresh-resolvers.txt -o /path/to/output
```


## Notes
- All the options are required to run the script.
- It also requires ip-addresses.txt file to perform VHOST scan so first get Ip-addresses about the target by performing reverse-domain on the target.(or comment it out if you don't require this option)
